This is a content management system website. We can add different posts and comments under the posts as users. We can also edit the posts, add users, specify user role, approve comments in the admin section of the website. A log in page is there to check if admins log in to direct them to the admin page. The front end of this website is created using HTML and CSS and the connection to the server for fetching and inserting information is done using PHP. Google chart(bar graph) is used on the admin page to give a visualization of number of posts, users and comments.
